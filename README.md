# Clustering
This project demonstrates K-means clustering using Python and scikit-learn. 
It generates random data points and applies K-means to cluster them into distinct groups. 
The script utilizes matplotlib for data visualization, showing both the initial data distribution and the clustered results with cluster centers marked.
